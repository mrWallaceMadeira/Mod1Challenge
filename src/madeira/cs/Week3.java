            Problem I
            ---------
            Prompt the user to enter two numbers
            Compare the two numbers and print out "First" if first is greater or "Second" second is greater
            This should handle decimals and integers at a wide range of values
            
            
            Problem II
            ----------
            Prompt the user to enter their favorite genre of music
            Reply with "Same!" if it is the same as your favorite genre or "Lame." if not.
            
            
            
            Problem III
            -----------
            Declare an integer, any integer.
            Prompt the user to guess your number.
            Give them 10 tries to get it right.
            If they do, present them with a congratulatory message, if not, roast them unfairly.
            
            
            
            Problem IV
            ----------
            Produce the following output using one print statement
            
            *****
            ****
            ***
            **
            *
            
            Problem V
            ---------
            Produce the following output using one print statement
            
            ****
            **
            *

            Problem VI
            ----------
            Declare an number, any number.
            Prompt the user to guess your number.
            Give them 10 tries to get it right.
            For each try they should either be:
                Hot: +/- 2 
                Medium: +/- 4
                Mild: +/- 8
            If they are Hot they should have 4 guesses subtracted from their total remaining
            If they are Medium they should have 2 guesses subtracted from their total remaining
            If they are Mild they should have 1 guess subtracted from their total remaining
            
            Edge Cases:
            If I have 4 guesses remaining and my guess is within 2 of the correct answer I should receive the prompt: "One more guess!"
            Same goes for 2 guesses remaining with a Medium guess
